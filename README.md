# 🚀 LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my personal collection of **LeetCode** solutions.
This repository is not just a code archive, but a journal of my journey to master algorithms, data structures, and software development best practices (Fullstack & IoT).

## 🎯 Goals
The main goal is not just "passing the tests," but writing code that is:
- **Efficient:** Strong focus on Time Complexity and Space Complexity analysis.
- **Readable:** Clean, "Pythonic," and well-commented code.
- **Robust:** Proper handling of edge cases and memory safety.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Key Concepts:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Greedy Algorithms, Bit Manipulation.
- **Documentation:** Every file includes a docstring with a step-by-step algorithm explanation and Big O analysis.
